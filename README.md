 # Omnifood projectðŸ¥³

## What is thisðŸ˜†?
This is the omnifood website that taught me all the fundemantals of html and css. This really gave me a grasp of what web development entails. Gave me the skills I needed in order to develop my own web pages

### This project is hosted on netlify so you can view it. (Next I am hosting my portfolio for everyone to seeðŸ˜‰)
